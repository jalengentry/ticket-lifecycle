End-users will create and submit tickets to your organization's help-desk, which in turn will be observed, assigned, and resolved.

Ex.

1.) Karen creates the ticket due to online banking system being down.

</p>
2.) Agent Jane sees the ticket in the help-desk and observes it.  After recogonizing the issue, she decides to change both the priority and SLA of the ticket to "Emergency" and "Sev-A", signaling the urgency in which the ticket needs to be resolved.  She also decides to assign this ticket to herself because she works under the Online Banking Team.

</p>
3.) All updates and changes to the ticket can be seen just below the ticket.  Jane replies to ticket announcing she is working on a resolution, it's important to keep both the customer and assisting team members updated.
